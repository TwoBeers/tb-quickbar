Quick access to blog contents and fast navigation for WordPress

== Description ==
Quick-menus has always been a distinctive characteristic of TwoBeers’s themes, since the first, unknown, The Black City.
Quickbar plugin was developed to give people a rapid access tool to their blog contents, without using a TwoBeers theme.
The plugin is somehow different from the theme’s quickbar as all the fix elements (last posts, comments and categories), were removed and replaced by a widget “box”. This will give blog’s admin the possibility to put what they want in constant evidence without “forcing” the user to scroll the page.
